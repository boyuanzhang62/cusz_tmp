cuSZ is a CUDA implementation of the widely used [SZ lossy compressor](https://github.com/szcompressor/SZ) for scientific data. It is the *first* error-bounded lossy compressor (circa 2020) on GPU for scientific data, aming to massively improve SZ's throughput on heterogeneous HPC systems.

# FAQ

There are technical differences between CPU-SZ and cuSZ, please refer to our academic papers for more information.  

<details>
<summary>
How does SZ/cuSZ work?
</summary>

Prediction-based SZ algorithm comprises four major parts,

0. User specifies error-mode (e.g., absolute value (`abs`), or relative to data value magnitude (`r2r`) and error-bound.
1. Prediction errors are quantized in units of input error-bound (*quant-code*). Range-limited quant-codes are stored, whereas the out-of-range codes are otherwise gathered as *outlier*.
3. The in-range quant-codes are fed into Huffman encoder. A Huffman symbol may be represented in multiple bytes.
4. (CPU-only) additional DEFLATE method is applied to exploit repeated patterns. As of CLUSTER '21 cuSZ+ work, an RLE method performs a similar pattern-exploiting.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Why is there multibyte symbol for Huffman?
</summary>

The principle of Huffman coding is to guarantee high-frequency symbols with fewer bits. To be specific, given arbitrary pairs of (symbol, frequency)-s, (*s<sub>i</sub>*, *f<sub>i</sub>*) and 
(*s<sub>j</sub>*, *f<sub>j</sub>*), the assigned codeword *c<sub>i</sub>* and *c<sub>j</sub>*, respectively, are guaranteed to have len(*c<sub>i</sub>*) is no greater than len(*c<sub>j</sub>*) if *f<sub>i</sub>* is no less than *f<sub>j</sub>*.

The combination of *n* single-byte does not reflect that quant-code representing the `+/-1` error-bound should be of the highest frequency. For example, an enumeration with 1024 symbols can cover 99.8% error-control code (the rest 0.2% can result in much more bits in codewords), among which the most frequent symbol can dominate at over 90%. If single-byte symbols are used, `0x00` from bytes near MSB makes

1. the highest frequency not properly represented, and
2. the pattern-exploiting harder. For example, `0x00ff,0x00ff` is otherwise interpreted as `0x00,0xff,0x00,0xff`.

What differentiates CPU-SZ and cuSZ in data quality and compression ratio?
</summary>

CPU-SZ offers a rich set of compression features and is far more mature than cuSZ. (1) CPU-SZ has preprocessing, more compression mode (e.g., point-wise), and autotuning. (2) CPU-SZ has Lorenzo predictor and Linear Regression, whereas cuSZ has Lorenzo (we are working on new predictors).

1. They share the same Lorenzo predictor. However, many factors affect data quality,
   1. preprocessing such as log transform and point-wise transform
   2. PSNR as a goal to autotune eb
   3. initial values from which we predict border values (as if padding). cuSZ predicts from zeros while SZ determines optimal values for, e.g., application-specific metrics. Also, note that cuSZ compression can result in a significantly higher PSNR than SZ (with the same eb, see Table 8 on page 10 of PACT '20 paper), but it is not necessarily better when it comes to applications.
   4. The PSNR serves as a generic metric: SZ guarantees a lower bound of PSNR when the eb is relative to the data range, e.g., 64 for 1e-3, 84 for 1e-4.
2. The linear scaling can be the same. SZ has an extra optimizer to decide the linear scaling range $[-r, +r]$; out-of-range quantization values are outliers. This is to optimize the compression ratio.
3. Currently, the Huffman encoding is the same except cuSZ partitions data (therefore, it has overhead in padding bits and partitioning metadata).

|        | preprocess | Lorenzo predictor | other predictors | Huffman | gzip/zstd   |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| CPU-SZ | x          | x                 | x                | x       | x           |

<summary>
What is cuSZ+?
</summary>

cuSZ+ is a follow-up peer-reviewed work in 2021, on top of the original 2020 work.
cuSZ+ mixes the improvements in decompression throughput (by 4.3x to 18.6x) and the use of data patterns that are the source of compressibility. 
There will not be, however, standalone software or version for cuSZ+. Instead, we are gradually rolling out the production-ready functionality mentioned in the published paper.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
What is the future plan/road map of cuSZ?
</summary>

1. more predictors based on domain-specific study and generality
2. more compression mode
3. both more modularized and more tightly coupled in components
4. APIs (soon)

</details>


<details>
<summary>
How to know the performance?
</summary>

1. `nvprof <cusz command>` for GPUs prior to Ampere
2. `nsys profile --stat true <cusz command>` for all GPUs
3. enable `--report time` in CLI
4. A sample benchmark is shown at [`doc/benchmark.md`](https://github.com/szcompressor/cuSZ/blob/master/doc/benchmark.md). To be updated.

<summary>
What are the limitations from the development?
</summary>

- The `double` support will be released in the next version.
- We are working on integrating faster Huffman codec
- 4-byte Huffman symbol may break; `--config huffbyte=8` is needed.
- tuning performance regarding different data input size
- adding preprocessing (e.g., binning, log-transform, normalization)
